To hide minecarts, use a resourcepack which
converts minecart texture into an invisible texture.

This datapack converts any 'stairs' block (oak_stairs,
spruce_stairs etc.) into a "shelf". 

To do this:
1) fetch any stairs block from your
creative inventory
2) then, run the command: /function shelves:convert
3) place the now converted shelf block and right click
to insert items that display on the stairs.
